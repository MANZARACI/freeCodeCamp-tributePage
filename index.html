            <p class="indent">The name of Atatürk reminds mankind of the historical accomplishments of one of the greatest men of this century: His leadership gave inspiration to the Turkish nation, farsightedness in the understanding of the modern world, and courage and power as a military leader. It is without a doubt that another example can not be shown indicating greater successes than the birth of the Turkish Republic, and ever since then Atatürk's and Turkey's broad and deep reforms undertaken, as well as the confidence of a nation in itself.</p>

                <p class="indent">I obtained information concerning Mustafa Kemal from someone who knows him very well. When talking with Foreign Minister Litvinov of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, he said that in his opinion, the most valuable and interesting statesman in all of Europe does not live in Europe today, but beyond the Bosphorus, he lives in Ankara, and that this was the President of the Turkish Republic, Gazi Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.</p>

                <p class="indent">We meet genius people very rarely in centuries. It is so unlucky that, in this century that great genius person belongs to the Turkish Nation. The centuries rarely produce a genius. Look at this bad luck of ours, that great genius of our era was granted to the Turkish nation.</p>

                <p class="indent">The ones who want to restore peace and health in this painful world, and who want mankind to develop not only materially but also morally, must take as an example and ponder upon Atatürk’s galvanization and course.</p>
